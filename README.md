# Project Conclave - A Metroid Item Tracker and Dependency Explorer
Item tracker for a number of games, vanilla and randomized.

Left and right clicks will toggle the icons. Middle click, if you have it, will toggle some overlaid icons, depending on the game and the item.

Left click on items with counters underneath them, will add one to the count. Right click will remove one.

All Metroid game graphics (with exception of fangames and derivative works) and Zelda Minish Cap graphics were made and owned by Nintendo Co., Ltd., Mercury Steam Entertainment S.L., and Capcom Co., Ltd., respectively. Graphics were ripped by me, and are used here without express permission and without intent to profit.

Rogue Dawn graphics were made by the Rogue Dawn creators, ripped by me, and are used here without express permission and without intent to profit.

AM2R graphics were made by the AM2R continuation team, ripped by me, and are used here without express permission and without intent to profit.

Prime 2D graphics were made by Team SCU, ripped by me (admittedly not very cleanly), and are used here without express permission and without intent to profit.

All Metroid placeholder icons were custom-made or kitbashed by me, intending to mimic or approximate an officially-owned graphical style (i.e. Nintendo's Metroid: Other M graphical style) without intent to profit.

Remainder Zelda graphics were custom-made or kitbashed by me, intending to mimic or approximate an officially-owned graphical style (i.e. Nintendo's Zelda Minish Cap graphical style) without intent to profit.



In loving memory of SpaghettiToastBook, who left such a great impact in the Metroid community, and whose original tracker inspired the first iteration of this project. We miss your light.
